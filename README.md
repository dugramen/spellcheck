# Spellcheck
A simple spell checking program.

**How to use:**

- `spellcheck.py` 
    Launches the spelling correction program. Enter some words and it will suggest corrections. Enter nothing to exit the program

- Add `-eval` or `-evaluate`
    To evaluate the accuracy and performance with 100 random words

- Add `-eval 50`
    Same as above, but with 50 random words (100 is default)

-  Add `edit` or `jaccard` at the end of any command to use Edit Distance and Jaccard Distance algorithms as well

-  Add `all` to use all the algorithms in the program

*Note: "Edit Distance" is particularly slow, so don't use too many words or evalutaions with that algorithm*

*The main algorithm uses Peter Norvig's technique*
